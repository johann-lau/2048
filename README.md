# 2048
A simple and plain-text Python implementation of the popular game 2048 in 92 lines. No dependencies.

I am just a teenager who have spent merely a few hours on this project. In simpler terms, you may find bugs.

As a player, just use `W` `A` `S` or `D` to make a move, or `Q` to quit the game. All of these are case-insensitive.

As a developer, this file includes adequate comments so that you can understand the algorithm easily.
